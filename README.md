#CS465 Final Project - Mood Music

Synthesia is a peculiar medical condition that combines senses together.

A person may:
* Hear a sound and see a color
* Smell something and hear a sound
* See a word and taste a flavor

This project is meant to be a representation of what Synthesia might look like to those who have it.

1. Enter a song or playlist
2. We calculate a color for each song 
3. Visualize your data!

This project uses an express backend, bootstrap frontend, and apis such as Spotify and d3.
